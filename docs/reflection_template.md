# Assignment 5: Reflection

## Part 1: LangGraph Workflow

1. How did you design the 8-node workflow? What considerations influenced the order of approval stages?

2. Describe your experience implementing the `interrupt()` pattern. What was intuitive and what was challenging?

3. How do the routing functions control the workflow? Why are conditional edges important for approval systems?

## Part 2: Safety Guardrails

1. What types of attacks does your input validation protect against? Are there any gaps?

2. How did you implement PII masking? What trade-offs exist between security and usability?

3. Why is output filtering important in financial systems, even when inputs are validated?

## Part 3: CopilotKit Frontend

1. How does the `useLangGraphInterrupt` hook connect the frontend to the backend workflow?

2. Describe the user experience when an approval interrupt fires. How did you design the UI to be clear and actionable?

3. What challenges did you face integrating CopilotKit with the LangGraph backend?

## Part 4: LangSmith Evaluation

1. How does your risk accuracy evaluator handle partial matches (adjacent risk levels)?

2. Why is evaluation important for production AI systems? How would you extend the evaluation suite?

3. What insights did the evaluation results reveal about your workflow's behavior?

## Bonus Features (if implemented)

1. Describe any bonus features you implemented and the design decisions behind them.
